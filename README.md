# Website Maker Dashboard Idea

This project is a concept for an E-Learning Dashboard tailored for "Non-Tech Freelancers" who want to build websites. It features a modern, dark-themed UI with a focus on business and sales topics.

## 🚀 How to Enable Live Website (GitHub Pages)

If you see a **404 Error**, you need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1.  **Open Repository Settings**:
    Go to: [https://github.com/temamumtaza/webmaker-idea/settings](https://github.com/temamumtaza/webmaker-idea/settings)

2.  **Go to Pages**:
    On the left sidebar, under the "Code and automation" section, click on **Pages**.

3.  **Configure Source**:
    - Under **Build and deployment**, find **Source**.
    - Select **Deploy from a branch**.

4.  **Select Branch**:
    - Under **Branch**, select `main`.
    - Ensure the folder is set to `/ (root)`.
    - Click **Save**.

5.  **Wait for Deployment**:
    - GitHub will take 1-2 minutes to build your site.
    - Refresh the page until the bar turns **Green**.
    - Click **Visit site** at the top.
